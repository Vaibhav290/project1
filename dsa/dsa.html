    <h3><b>What is Data Structrues?</b></h3>
    <p>A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.</p>
    <p>A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Linear data structure:</b> Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Static data structure:</b> Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
                An example of this data structure is an array.</li>
            <li> <b>Dynamic data structure:</b> In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
                Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Non-linear data structure:</b> Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
            Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.</li>
    </ul>

     <h3><b>Types of Data Structures : </b></h3>
     <p>As there are many types of data structures but we only study the important one reqeuired for placements.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Array</li>
        <li>Linked List</li>
        <li>Stack</li>
        <li>Queue</li>
        <li>Binary Tree</li>
        <li>Binary Search Tree</li>
        <li>Hashing</li>
        <li>Graph</li>
       </ul>
    <h3><b>Array</b></h3>
    <p>An <b>array</b> is a <b>linear data structure</b> that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations. Arrays work on an index system starting from 0 to (n-1), where n is the size of the array.</p>
    <p><b>Why Do You Need an Array in Data Structures?</b></p>

    <p>Let's suppose a class consists of ten students, and the class has to publish their results. If you had declared all ten variables individually, it would be challenging to manipulate and maintain the data. 

        If more students were to join, it would become more difficult to declare all the variables and keep track of it. To overcome this problem, arrays came into the picture.</p>
        <p><b>Types of Arrays : </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>One-Dimensional Arrays: </b>
            <img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Vaibhav-Arrays%20Article/Arrays_in_ds-array-type-1d-img1.PNG" alt="image" class="center4">You can imagine a 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Dimensional Arrays: </b>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Two-Dimensional Arrays :</b> <img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Vaibhav-Arrays%20Article/Arrays_in_ds-array-type-2d-img1.PNG" alt="image" class="center5"> </li>
                <li> <b>Three-Dimensional Arrays:</b> <img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Vaibhav-Arrays%20Article/Arrays_in_ds-array-type-3d-img1.PNG" alt="image" class="center6"></li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>How Do You Declare an Array?</b></p>
        <p>Arrays are typically defined with square brackets with the size of the arrays as its argument. <br>

            Here is the syntax for arrays: <br>
            
            1D Arrays: int arr[n]; <br>
            
            2D Arrays: int arr[m][n]; <br>
            
            3D Arrays: int arr[m][n][o];</p>
